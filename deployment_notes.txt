This is a great directory structure. It clarifies exactly where your data lives (`app/datasets`) and how your modules are nested.

Based on this tree and the Ampere A1 requirement, here is the **revised, production-ready `docker-compose.yml`**.

### Key Changes for this Structure:

1.  **Unified Data Persistence (`app_data`):**
      * Your tree shows a lot of data in `app/datasets` (Parquet files, artifacts).
      * We must map a volume to **`/usr/src/app/app/datasets`**. If we don't, all those uploads and generated reports will vanish when the container restarts.
      * **Crucial:** The Celery workers and the FastAPI app **must share this volume** so the worker can process files uploaded by the API.
2.  **SQLite Database:**
      * I see `test.sqlite` in your root. In Docker, this will be at `/usr/src/app/test.sqlite`.
      * To save this DB, we need to map a volume to it, or (better practice) move the DB into a `data/` folder.
      * *For this config, I have added a volume mapping for the DB file specifically to prevent data loss.*
3.  **Build Context:**
      * We use `context: .` for all Python services so they can copy `app/`, `streamlit_app/`, and root files like `.env` correctly.



### Pre-deployment Setup (Required)

Because we are mapping files from the Host to the Container, you need to set up the host folders on your Ampere instance *before* running `docker compose up`.

Run these commands on your server:

1.  **Create the Data Structure:**

    ```bash
    # Create the folder for datasets
    mkdir -p app_data/datasets

    # Create the folder for the database
    mkdir -p app_data/db

    # Create an empty sqlite file so Docker doesn't create it as a folder
    touch app_data/db/test.sqlite
    ```

2.  **Permissions (Crucial for Linux):**
    By default, the container might not have permission to write to these folders created by your user.

    ```bash
    # Give full permissions (easiest fix for single-server deployment)
    chmod -R 777 app_data
    ```

3.  **Deploy:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

### 🔍 Why did I add the SQLite Volume?

I saw `test.sqlite` in your root directory.

  * **Without the volume:** Every time you redeploy (update code), the container is destroyed and recreated. Your database resets to empty.
  * **With the volume:** The database file lives in `./app_data/db/test.sqlite` on the server disk. You can update the app as many times as you want, and your users/tasks will remain saved.
